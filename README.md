# Metal_Detector_demo

A simple Android app which acts as a METAL DETECTOR.

Latest Progress: The magnitude of the Magnetic field is shown on the screen. It changes rapidly so the values are rounded off to only integer values.

What is expected? It is a simple application that uses the magnetometer sensor hardware on your device. Bring the phone closer to a metal and the phone continues to vibrate. If you remove the metal, the phone stops vibrating. If you want to detect even the small metal pieces, the system would give too many false positives, on the other hand if you want high accuracy of detection, you should look out for big metals.
